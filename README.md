Implement a client with an attractive graphical interface that will play the role of remote (remote) for multiple "smart devices" (competing servers). The client will be able to choose with which devices to connect from the available ones (minimum 3, such as light bulb, TV remote control, one more to choose) and will be able to change the state (increase the volume, change the channel, etc.). These status changes will be visible in both the interface and server status.
